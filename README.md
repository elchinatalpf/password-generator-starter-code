This project is about generating a random password based on the user's input. It is a simple program in JavaScript that asks prompt questions to the user. The responses will be used to generate the password using lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters; then, the password is generated.

## Tasks Achieved
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
